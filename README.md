# Spectrum Analyzer Demo

This is a spectrum analyzer demo using the HTML5 Web Audio API, [dsp.js](https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js) and [d3.js](http://d3js.org).

A frequency sweep mp3 is included for demo purposes but any audio file can be used.

There is a config.ru file included so that you can serve the project locally using [Rack](http://rack.github.com)
